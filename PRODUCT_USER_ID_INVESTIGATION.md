# Product User ID Investigation Results

## Current Situation

The issue is now clearly identified. Here's what happens during developer login:

### Auth Login (Success)
1. ✅ Developer Auth login succeeds
2. ✅ No Epic Account ID (this is expected for developer login)
3. ✅ Login status set to LoggedIn

### Connect Login (Fails)
1. ❌ Connect login with Device ID fails with error 10
2. ❌ Error 10 means EOS Dev Auth Tool not running on localhost:7777
3. ❌ No Product User ID because Connect login failed

## Root Cause

**Product User ID comes from the Connect service, not the Auth service.**

Developer login is purely an Auth service operation. To get a Product User ID, you must successfully complete a Connect login, which requires:

- EOS Dev Auth Tool running on localhost:7777 (for development)
- OR a different Connect authentication method

## Possible Solutions

### Option 1: Run EOS Dev Auth Tool
- Start EOS Dev Auth Tool on localhost:7777
- Both Auth and Connect logins will succeed
- You'll get both Epic Account credentials and Product User ID

### Option 2: Separate Connect Login
- Accept that developer login is Auth-only (no Product User ID)
- Provide a separate Device ID login button for Connect-only login
- This gives you a Product User ID without Epic Account credentials

### Option 3: Alternative Connect Method
- Use a different Connect authentication method that doesn't require Dev Auth Tool
- This would require different EOS configuration

### Option 4: Accept Current Behavior
- Developer login provides Auth credentials only (no Product User ID)
- This is standard EOS behavior for developer authentication

## Current Code Behavior

The code is now working correctly:
- ✅ Developer Auth login succeeds and provides display name
- ✅ Attempts Connect login to get Product User ID
- ✅ Handles Connect login failure gracefully
- ✅ Reports detailed error information (error 10)

## Recommendation

For development purposes, **Option 1 (Run EOS Dev Auth Tool)** is recommended as it allows full testing of both Auth and Connect services.

For production, you would typically use Epic Account login (which includes both Auth and Connect) or separate Device ID login for Connect-only scenarios.
