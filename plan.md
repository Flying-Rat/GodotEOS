# GodotEpic Development Plan
## Epic Online Services (EOS) Integration for Godot Engine

This document outlines the 14-day development plan for creating a comprehensive EOS integration plugin for Godot Engine.

---

## **Day 1 – Setup & Architecture**

**Work:**
- Draft plugin architecture (study GodotSteam as reference)
- Research EOS SDK, APIs, and integration points
- Set up EOS backend project in Epic Dev Portal
- Prepare build system, test EOS SDK with a standalone binary

**Result:** Clear technical plan + working EOS sandbox project

**Acceptance:** EOS Dev Portal project configured, Godot plugin skeleton exists in repo

---

## **Day 2 – EOS Initialization & Profile**

**Work:**
- Implement EOS SDK initialization in GDExtension
- Create GodotEpic singleton for lifecycle management
- Retrieve basic account/profile info and print to Godot console

**Result:** Plugin loads EOS SDK, prints profile info

**Acceptance:** Run test project → confirmed EOS init + profile retrieval works

---

## **Day 3 – Authentication & License Check**

**Work:**
- Wrap EOS Authentication API (Dev Auth + Epic login)
- Expose login/logout to Godot with signals for callbacks
- Implement license validation
- Create basic Godot UI with login button

**Result:** Player can log in, license is checked

**Acceptance:** Run game → see successful login + license status in console

---

## **Day 4 – Achievements API**

**Work:**
- Implement EOS Achievements API (query + unlock)
- Expose to Godot as `unlock_achievement(id)` and signals for updates
- Add demo scene with unlock button

**Result:** Achievements can be unlocked from Godot script

**Acceptance:** Trigger achievement in test scene → verify in EOS Dev Portal

---

## **Day 5 – Stats API**

**Work:**
- Wrap EOS Stats API (query, ingest/update)
- Expose methods like `update_stat(id, value)` and `get_stats()`
- Create test UI to display and update stats

**Result:** Stats can be updated and retrieved in Godot

**Acceptance:** Update stat in test scene → verify change in EOS Dev Portal

---

## **Day 6 – Leaderboards API**

**Work:**
- Implement EOS Leaderboards API (submit + query scores)
- Expose to Godot: `submit_score(board_id, score)` + `get_leaderboard(board_id)`
- Build demo leaderboard scene in Godot

**Result:** Players can submit scores + retrieve leaderboard ranks

**Acceptance:** Submit test score from Godot → visible in EOS portal leaderboard

---

## **Day 7 – Cloud Saves**

**Work:**
- Wrap EOS Cloud Storage API (write + read)
- Expose to Godot: `save_file(name, data)`, `load_file(name)`
- Create test UI: save/load JSON or text file

**Result:** Player can save and load a file to EOS cloud

**Acceptance:** Save test file in game → download/verify content via EOS tools

---

## **Day 8 – Godot API Polish**

**Work:**
- Improve integration: add signals, clean method names, autoload plugin
- Ensure consistent GDScript API: `EpicOS.*`
- Update demo scenes to only use GDScript (no C++ changes required)

**Result:** Godot devs can call EpicOS methods directly with signals

**Acceptance:** Test project shows achievements/stats/leaderboards integrated via GDScript only

---

## **Day 9 – Documentation**

**Work:**
- Write setup guide (install, build, configure EOS)
- Provide API reference for available methods
- Add code snippets for each major API (auth, stats, achievements, leaderboards, saves)

**Result:** Clear setup guide for devs

**Acceptance:** New developer can follow README and initialize the plugin without extra help

---

## **Day 10 – Demo Project**

**Work:**
- Build a complete demo scene combining login, achievements, stats, leaderboards, and cloud saves
- Ensure scene is beginner-friendly (UI buttons → calls EpicOS methods)
- Test demo flow from init → login → achievements → save file

**Result:** Working demo game showcasing all APIs

**Acceptance:** Fresh Godot install → follow README → demo runs successfully

---

## **Day 11 – Cross-Platform Debugging (Buffer)**

**Work:**
- Test plugin on Linux & Windows builds
- Check build configs, path issues, and SDK linking differences
- Fix platform-specific crashes or API inconsistencies

**Result:** Plugin works reliably on multiple OS

**Acceptance:** Run demo on Windows and Linux → same behavior, no critical errors

---

## **Day 12 – Network & Callback Stability (Buffer)**

**Work:**
- Stress test authentication (failed login, timeout, cancel flow)
- Validate callbacks and signals (ensure no deadlocks or missed signals)
- Add fallback logging for network/API errors

**Result:** More stable error handling for EOS services

**Acceptance:** Invalid login or offline mode → handled gracefully without crash

---

## **Day 13 – Polish & CI/CD (Buffer)**

**Work:**
- Set up GitHub Actions for automated builds on Linux/Windows
- Add better error messages and debug logs
- Clean repo structure: `/src`, `/demo`, `/docs`

**Result:** CI/CD pipeline ready + clean repo

**Acceptance:** Push to repo → CI builds artifacts successfully

---

## **Day 14 – Final Testing & Release (Buffer)**

**Work:**
- Full regression test of all features in demo
- Package plugin as zip + write release notes
- Upload to GitHub Releases (and prep for Godot Asset Store submission)

**Result:** Stable plugin package ready for developers

**Acceptance:** Plugin installs cleanly, demo runs without errors, docs match features

---

## **Key Milestones**

- **Days 1-3:** Foundation (Setup, Init, Auth)
- **Days 4-7:** Core APIs (Achievements, Stats, Leaderboards, Cloud Saves)
- **Days 8-10:** Polish & Demo
- **Days 11-14:** Testing & Release (Buffer days)

## **Success Criteria**

1. **Technical:** All EOS APIs accessible from GDScript
2. **Usability:** Simple API calls with signal-based callbacks
3. **Documentation:** Complete setup guide + API reference
4. **Demo:** Working example showcasing all features
5. **Stability:** Cross-platform compatibility with error handling
